## Character Ethic vs. Personality Ethic

The book, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," defines the **Character Ethic** and the **Personality Ethic** as two distinct foundations for success, with a significant shift in focus between them over time.

Here's an explanation of each:

- **The Character Ethic**:
    - This ethic was the foundation of success literature for approximately the first 150 years after 1776 in the United States.
    - It taught that **true success and enduring happiness** come from learning and integrating basic **principles of effective living** into one's fundamental character.
    - Examples of these principles include **integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty, and the Golden Rule**.
    - Benjamin Franklin's autobiography is cited as representative of this literature, illustrating one man's effort to embed these principles and habits deeply within his nature.
    
- **The Personality Ethic**:
    - This view of success emerged shortly after World War I, shifting from the Character Ethic.
    - It defines success primarily as a function of **personality, public image, attitudes, behaviours, skills, and techniques** that facilitate human interaction.
    - This ethic generally took two paths: human and public relations techniques, and positive mental attitude (PMA).
    - While some aspects included valid maxims like "Your attitude determines your altitude," other parts were described as **manipulative or deceptive**, encouraging the use of techniques to get others to like you or to feign interest to achieve desired outcomes.
    - The book suggests that this ethic is often **superficial**, providing "social Band-Aids and aspirin" that offer temporary relief for acute problems but leave underlying chronic issues unaddressed.
    - It is seen as the subconscious source of "quick-fix" solutions that often don't address the fundamental problems.
